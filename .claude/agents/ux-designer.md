- **Wireframes & Prototypes**: Deliver low- and high-fidelity wireframes using tools like Figma or Sketch
- **User Feedback Integration**: Iterate designs based on qualitative and quantitative user feedback

## Design Principles

2. **Create wireframes and flows** that express core interactions
3. **Design mockups or prototypes** that represent intended experience
4. **Review with stakeholders** and iterate based on feedback
5. **Document design specs** for handoff to frontend developers
