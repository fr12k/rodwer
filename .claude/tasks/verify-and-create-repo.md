# Verify Project & Create Repository Plan

## Overview
Verify that the rodwer browser automation framework works correctly and create a new GitHub repository at github.com/fr12k/rodwer with an initial commit.

## Phase 1: Project Verification

### 1.1 Test Suite Execution
- [x] Run quick smoke tests: `go test -short -v -run="Quick"` (~6s)
- [ ] Run full test suite: `go test -v` (~60-90s)  
- [ ] Verify coverage collection: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.txt ./...`
- [ ] Check test results and ensure all tests pass

### 1.2 Code Quality Validation
- [ ] Verify Go modules are properly configured
- [ ] Check project structure and dependencies
- [ ] Ensure no compilation errors exist

## Phase 2: Repository Creation at github.com/fr12k/rodwer

### 2.1 Repository Initialization
- [ ] Create new GitHub repository with `gh repo create fr12k/rodwer --public`
- [ ] Initialize git repository locally if not already done
- [ ] Update go.mod module path to `github.com/fr12k/rodwer`

### 2.2 Initial Commit
- [ ] Add all project files to git
- [ ] Create meaningful initial commit message
- [ ] Push to GitHub repository

### 2.3 Repository Setup
- [ ] Verify repository is properly created and accessible
- [ ] Confirm all files are present in the remote repository
- [ ] Add appropriate repository description and topics

## Expected Outcomes
- All tests pass successfully, confirming the browser automation framework works
- New GitHub repository created at github.com/fr12k/rodwer
- Initial commit contains complete working project
- Repository is properly configured with correct module path

## Validation Criteria
- Test suite completes without failures
- Browser automation functionality verified through tests
- Coverage reports generated successfully
- GitHub repository accessible and contains all project files

## Implementation Notes
- Following TDD methodology as outlined in project documentation
- Using existing test commands from CLAUDE.md
- Maintaining project structure and conventions
- Ensuring proper error handling and validation
